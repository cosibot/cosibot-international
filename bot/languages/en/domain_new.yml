          prevalence of these conditions in the elderly age groups in China, therefore
          they might be surrogates of increasing age only. Higher ACE (angiotensin-converting
          enzyme II) gene expression may be linked to higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.
          It has been shown that ACE 2 expression in lung tissues increases with age,
          tobacco use and with some hypertensive treatment. These observations might
          explain the vulnerability of older people, tobacco users/smokers and those
          with hypertension; they also highlight the importance of identifying smokers
          as a potential vulnerable group for COVID-19.<a href='https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/RRA-seventh-update-Outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-COVID-19.pdf'

          of people are the ideal breeding ground for conspiracy theories, false reports
          or myths. People often find out about the virus on various YouTube channels
          where online activists believe they know the true origin of the virus. False
          reports are also increasingly circulating via social media such as Facebook
          or WhatsApp. This can, for example, lead to increasing panic and panic buying.
          Therefore, please make sure that you only inform yourself on official websites
