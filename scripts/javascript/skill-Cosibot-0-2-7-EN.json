Higher ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme II) gene expression may be linked to higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. It has been shown that ACE 2 expression in lung tissues increases with age, tobacco use and with some hypertensive treatment. These observations might explain the vulnerability of older people, tobacco users/smokers and those with hypertension; they also highlight the importance of identifying smokers as a potential vulnerable group for COVID-19.<a href='https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/RRA-seventh-update-Outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-COVID-19.pdf' target='_blank'>(1)</a></p>\"\n}"
